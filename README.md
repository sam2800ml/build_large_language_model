# Build a Large Language Model - Code Repository

This repository contains all the code I've written while working through the book **"Build a Large Language Model"**. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress, share my implementations, and provide a reference for others who might be following along with the book.

## About the Book

**"Build a Large Language Model"** is a comprehensive guide that walks readers through the process of building a large language model from scratch. The book covers various topics, including:

- Fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP)
